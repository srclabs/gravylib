# Gravy (WIP)
###### *Ya know, my momma always said everything's better with Gravy...*

**Gravy** is an attempt to build a modern programming framework for GPU-first development. It builds on [`rust-gpu`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-gpu) as a backend to convert Rust syntax into a GPU program, and then makes use of [`wgpu`](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) and [`winit`](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit) to run the program with cross-platform support.

It will be usable as a standalone Rust library crate (`gravylib`), but the goal is to build an IDE-like experience on top of `gravylib` to make GPU-first development simple and accessible for all Rust developers.

This project is still a Work In Progress, and is not usable in it's current state. Pull requests are discouraged until this changes. However, if you want to learn more about the project, you can join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/7cBw5KHe6q).
