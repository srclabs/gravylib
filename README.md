# Gravy (WIP)
###### *Ya know, my momma always said everything's better with Gravy...*

**Gravy** is an attempt to build a modern programming framework for GPU-first development. It builds on [`rust-gpu`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-gpu) as a backend to convert Rust syntax into a GPU program, and then makes use of [`wgpu`](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) and [`winit`](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit) to run the program with cross-platform support.

This project is still a Work In Progress, and is not usable in it's current state. Pull requests are discouraged until this changes. However, if you still want to contribute, you can join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/7cBw5KHe6q).
